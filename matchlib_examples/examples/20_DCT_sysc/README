DCT block implemented with SystemC and Matchlib and synthesized thru Catapult HLS

This example also demonstrates usage of the CONNECTIONS_FAST_SIM option for the pre-HLS SystemC
simulation. To use this option, instead of "make build", use "make fast_sim_sc" below. The resulting
executable will then be named "fast_sim_sc". To measure difference in simulation performance use:

time ./fast_sim_sc sample.bmp
time ./sim_sc sample.bmp

Note that in this case we omit generation of the ".vcd" files so that it does not affect sim performance.

Steps:

1. Build the SystemC simulation executable by typing:
   make build

2. Run the SC simulation by typing:
   ./sim_sc sample.bmp

3. View the waveforms generated from the SC simulation:
   make view_wave

4. Run Catapult HLS to generate Verilog RTL for DUT:
   catapult -f go_hls.tcl

5. Launch SCVerify / QuestaSim with generated RTL by typing in Catapult command line:
   dofile scverify.tcl

6. View the RTL simulation waveforms and compare to SC waveforms before HLS synthesis

7. Delete all generated files
    make clean
