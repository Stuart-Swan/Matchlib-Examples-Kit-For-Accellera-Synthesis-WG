Note, also see ../53_transactor_modeling for additional transactor modeling guidelines.

The APB DMA has an apb_slave interface (for the testbench to program the DMA) and an apb_master
interface (for performing the DMA copy operations to the RAM).

The apb_slave interface uses the apb_slave_xactor model, which is a separate SC_THREAD
using Matchlib connections interfaces with the main process. Modeling this using pragma modulario
is not possible, since the slave transactor needs to send requests to the DMA slave process,
and receive responses from the DMA slave process.  So using a separate SC_THREAD
is the only possible way to model such a slave transactor.

The apb_master interface has several different implementation options:

1) apb_master_rw(...) : This is a simple function that performs the APB protocol
which is inlined into the calling process.
It does not use pragma modulario.  
The DMA inner loop cannot be pipelined with this approach (would result in scheduling failure).
This modeling approach gives best QOR, including best final thruput:

Area: 3673
Thruput: 8 ns

2A) apb_master_rw(...) using pragma modulario: Same as above, but apply the modulario pragma:
The DMA inner loop is NOT pipelined.

Area: 3865
Thruput: 9 ns

2B) apb_master_rw(...) using pragma modulario: Same as above, but apply the modulario pragma:
The DMA inner loop is pipelined with II=2 and stall_mode=stall

Area: 3916
Thruput: 8 ns

3) apb_master_xactor() : This is a separate SC_THREAD that uses Matchlib Connections
to communicate with the DMA process.
The DMA inner loop is NOT pipelined. Pipelining is possible but provides no benefit in this case.

Area: 4292
Thruput: 12 ns

General Guidelines for Transactor Modeling

1. To achieve best QOR in Catapult, transactor models must only have a single wait() statement.
In apb_master_rw() we see the single wait() statement within a simple while() loop.
In apb_slave_xactor we see the single wait() statement within a while() loop that has a switch statement
modeling the state of the transactor FSM. This is known as the "explicit FSM" modeling style.

2. When choosing a transactor modeling style,
you can pick an approach that works for your case from this list:

  1. Inline  (case 1 above)
      - does not allow pipelining of the caller
      - does not enable parallel execution of more than one transactor call in the RTL
  2. Modulario (cases 2A and 2B above)
      - allows pipelining of the caller
      - enables parallel execution of more than one transactor call in the RTL
      - does not support thruput accurate pre-HLS simulation
  3. Separate SC_THREAD (case 3 above)
      - allows pipelining of the caller
      - enables parallel execution of more than one transactor call in the RTL
      - does support thruput accurate pre-HLS simulation
      - may have small area + latency cost compared to other two approaches in certain cases like this particular example

It should be noted that this apb_dma example likely exagerates the area and latency differences
between the 3 approaches, since the actual core design does not consume any area or latency.
A more balanced assessment of the 3 different approachs is provided in ../53_transactor_modeling,
and in particular that example highlights key issues related to throughput accurate modeling
and potential simulation hangs with approaches #1 and #2.

If you want to use the modulario approach since it might provid a small QOR benefit in 
some cases, but also want throughput accurate modeling in your pre-HLS simulation, you can implement
transactors for both the modulario and SC_THREAD approaches and use 
  #ifdef __SYNTHESIS__
  #else
  #endif
to select the modulario version for HLS and the SC_THREAD version for pre-HLS simulation.

3. To model a slave transactor that sends a request and receives a response 
from the user's main process, you must use the separate SC_THREAD modeling 
approach (as in apb_slave_xactor).

4. Sometimes design "stuttering" problems can arise when using transactors due
to communication paths external to the process that have latency.  See example
73_stutter_fix for a discussion of this topic.
