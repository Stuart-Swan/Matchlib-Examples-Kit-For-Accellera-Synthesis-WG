Very simple Matchlib model showing Pre-HLS and Post-HLS simulations.

This example demonstrates and tests the automatic generation of required field member functions
for user defined structs and classes which are used as transaction types in Matchlib and SystemC models.

For additional information on this example see:
../../doc/auto_gen_field_methods.pdf

The dut.h file shows how the statement:

AUTO_GEN_FIELD_METHODS(...)

is used to automatically generate the following required member functions for such user-defined
transaction classes:

1.  template <unsigned int Size> void Marshall(Marshaller<Size>& m);
   - This function is needed for Matchlib connections.

2.  inline friend void sc_trace(sc_trace_file *tf, const this_type &v, const std::string &NAME );
   - This function is needed for SystemC standard waveform tracing support.

3.  inline friend std::ostream &operator<<(ostream &os, const this_type &rhs);
   - This function is needed for SystemC standard transaction streaming/printing support.

4.  static const unsigned int width = ... ;
   - This constant is needed for Matchlib connections.

5.  bool operator==(const this_type & rhs) const ;
   - This function is needed for transactions that are used with SystemC sc_signal<T>

Note that these functions only need to be provided for user-defined transaction types
(which is what the AUTO_GEN_FIELD_METHODS( ) macro does). All of the built in data types
such as ac_int<> , sc_int<>, int, uint8, etc., have these capabilities provided by the libraries.


Steps:

1. Build the SystemC simulation executable by typing:
   make build

2. Run the SC simulation by typing:
   ./sim_sc

  Note the transaction results are automatically 
  printed to stdout and also into the chan_log* files in readable form.

3. View the waveforms generated from the SC simulation:
   make view_wave

4. Run Catapult HLS to generate Verilog RTL for DUT:
   catapult -f go_hls.tcl

5. Launch SCVerify / QuestaSim with generated RTL by typing in Catapult command line:
   dofile scverify.tcl

6. Run RTL Sim by typing in QuestaSim command line:
   run -all
   wave zoom full

7. View the RTL simulation waveforms and compare to SC waveforms before HLS synthesis

8. Delete all generated files
    make clean
