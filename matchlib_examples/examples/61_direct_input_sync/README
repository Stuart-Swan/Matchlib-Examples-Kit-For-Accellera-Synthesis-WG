Catapult SystemC Direct Inputs "Stress Test"

For a description of this test see the section on "Direct Inputs" in:
$MGC_HOME/shared/examples/matchlib/toolkit/doc/catapult_user_view_scheduling_rules.docx
or
../../doc/catapult_user_view_scheduling_rules.docx

Note that run_logs dir contains pre-generated response logs for the cases below.
These enable easy comparison of scenarios below just by using "diff".


A. Pre-HLS Steps:

1. Build and run the SystemC simulation executable by typing:
   (Output responses will be in pre_hls.log)

   make run

   View the waveforms generated from the SC simulation:
   make view_wave


B. Post-HLS Using Regular SystemC signals (ie no direct inputs):
   (Output responses will be logged to regular_signals.log)

   BATCH: make regular_signals

   INTERACTIVE: catapult -f regular_signals.tcl &
                dofile scverify.tcl

C. Post-HLS Using Direct Inputs and DIRECT_INPUT_SYNC
   (Output responses will be logged to direct_input_sync.log)

   BATCH: make direct_input_sync

   INTERACTIVE: catapult -f direct_input_sync.tcl &
                dofile scverify.tcl


D. Post-HLS Using Direct Inputs and NO DIRECT_INPUT_SYNC
   (Output responses will be logged to direct_input_no_sync.log)

   BATCH: make direct_input_no_sync

   INTERACTIVE: catapult -f direct_input_no_sync.tcl &
                dofile scverify.tcl
