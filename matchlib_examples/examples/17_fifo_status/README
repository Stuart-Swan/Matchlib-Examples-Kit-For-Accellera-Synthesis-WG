Very simple Matchlib model showing Pre-HLS and Post-HLS simulations that demonstrates Matchlib Pop/Push operations on  FIFO that includes status signals (is_full, is_empty, etc).
Note that the SystemC model and the HLS generated RTL have a thruput of 1 NS (1 NS clock).


Steps:

1. Build the SystemC simulation executable by typing:
   make build

2. Run the SC simulation by typing:
   ./sim_sc

3. View the waveforms generated from the SC simulation:
   make view_wave

4. Run Catapult HLS to generate Verilog RTL for DUT:
   catapult -f go_hls.tcl

5. Launch SCVerify / QuestaSim with generated RTL by typing in Catapult command line:
   dofile scverify.tcl

6. Run RTL Sim by typing in QuestaSim command line:
   run -all
   wave zoom full

7. View the RTL simulation waveforms and compare to SC waveforms before HLS synthesis

8. Delete all generated files
    make clean
