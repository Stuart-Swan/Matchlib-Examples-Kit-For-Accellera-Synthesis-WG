This example demonstrates how to automatically generate a Verilog wrapper for the Catapult 
generated RTL that has all of the fields that are within ports which are structs/classes split out
as separate input/output ports in the Verilog wrapper.
Having separate input/output ports at the Verilog top level is sometimes required
in some customer flows.



Steps:

1. Build the SystemC simulation executable by typing:
   make build

2. Run the SC simulation by typing:
   ./sim_sc
   Running ./sim_sc will automatically create the Verilog wrapper "dut_split_wrap.v".
   View this file to understand what the wrapper is doing.

3. View the waveforms generated from the SC simulation:
   make view_wave

4. Run Catapult HLS to generate Verilog RTL for DUT:
   catapult -f go_hls.tcl
   Note that Catapult has no knowledge of the Verilog wrapper and is run with normal options.

5. Launch SCVerify / QuestaSim with generated RTL by typing in Catapult command line:
   dofile scverify.tcl

6. Run RTL Sim by typing in QuestaSim command line:
   run -all
   wave zoom full
   Note that when the RTL is simulated within SCVerify, the Verilog wrapper is not used.

7. View the RTL simulation waveforms and compare to SC waveforms before HLS synthesis

8. Run the simulation using the Verilog TB and Verilog DUT with the split port wrapper:
   make vsim
   Note that the dut_wrap module has all of the fields split out as separate ports.

9. Delete all generated files
    make clean
