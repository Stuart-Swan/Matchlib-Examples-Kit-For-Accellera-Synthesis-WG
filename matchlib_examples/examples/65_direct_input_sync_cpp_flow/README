Catapult C++ Flow Direct Inputs "Stress Test"


This example is the same as the example in ../61_direct_input_sync, however 
example 61* is for the Catapult SystemC flow while this example uses the Catapult C++ flow.

For a description of this test see the section on "Direct Inputs" in:
$MGC_HOME/shared/examples/matchlib/toolkit/doc/catapult_user_view_scheduling_rules.docx
or
../../doc/catapult_user_view_scheduling_rules.docx

Note that run_logs dir contains pre-generated response logs for the cases below.
These enable easy comparison of scenarios below just by using "diff".

Note that the Catapult direct_input_sync and STRICT_IO_SCHEDULING=STRICT directives are 
essential to proper operation of this modeling approach.

Steps:

1. Build pre-HLS C++ model:
   make build

2. Run pre-HLS C++ model:
   ./sim_sc

   Note that outputs will be written to "resp.log".
   This can be compared with logs in run_logs/*

3. Run Catapult:
   catapult -f go_hls.tcl &

4. Launch Questa on post-HLS RTL within Catapult GUI.

5. In Questa, to run the simulation type:

   run -all

6. View waveforms.

7. Type:
   quit

   Note that outputs will be written to "resp.log".
   This can be compared with logs in run_logs/*
