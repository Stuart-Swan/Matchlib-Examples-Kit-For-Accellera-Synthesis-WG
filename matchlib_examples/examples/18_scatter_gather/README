This simple example demonstrates a "throughput accurate" scatter-gather DMA model using NVidia Matchlib and Catapult HLS.

See the presentation ./scatter_gather_dma.pdf for details on this example.

Steps:

1. Build SystemC model:
   make build

2. Run SystemC model:
   ./sim_sc

3. View VCD waveforms from SystemC model before HLS:

   make view_wave

   Note the automated burst segmentation (for easy visualization, this example segments every 16 beats rather than the standard axi4 of 256 beats)

4. Run catapult HLS:
   catapult -file go_hls.tcl

5. Launch QuestaSim on generated RTL:
   Verification->
      QuestaSim->
        RTL Verilog   (Double click)

6. In QuestaSim GUI, at command prompt:
     run -all
     wave zoom full

  Note in Questasim transcript log :
 90 ns sc_main/Top/testbench beat rate: 1078 ps
 90 ns sc_main/Top/testbench clock period: 1 ns

  Note in the waveforms the concurrent burst read and writes from the DMA fully utilize the AXI4 bus.

7. If desired, delete generated files:
   make clean
