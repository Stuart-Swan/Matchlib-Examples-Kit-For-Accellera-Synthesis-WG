This simple example demonstrates an "and_gate" that is modeled in SystemC and synthesized to RLT via Catapult HLS.
The purpose of this example is show how a very simple combinational process in SystemC maps to Verilog RTL.


Steps:

1. View "and_gate.h" and note similarities/differences to a Verilog module.
   view and_gate.h

2. View testbench.h to see instantiation and stimulus of DUT.
   view testbench.h

3. Build the SystemC simulation executable by typing:
   make build

4. Run the SC simulation by typing:
   ./sim_sc

5. View the waveforms generated from the SC simulation:
   make view_wave

6. Run Catapult HLS to generate Verilog RTL for DUT:
   catapult -f go_hls.tcl

7. Launch SCVerify / QuestaSim with generated RTL by typing in Catapult command line:
   dofile scverify.tcl

8. Run RTL Sim by typing in QuestaSim command line:
   run -all
   wave zoom full

9. View the RTL simulation waveforms and compare to SC waveforms before HLS synthesis

10. View generated RTL and compare to SC model before HLS synthesis
   view Catapult/and_gate.v1/rtl.v

11. Delete all generated files
    make clean
