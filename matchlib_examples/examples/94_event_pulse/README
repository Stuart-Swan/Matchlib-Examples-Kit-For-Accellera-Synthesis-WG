Very simple Matchlib model showing Pre-HLS and Post-HLS simulations that demonstrates Matchlib Pop/Push operations and the usage of p2p_event class to generate 1 cycle "pulse" events on an interface.


Steps:

1. Build the SystemC simulation executable by typing:
   make build

2. Run the SC simulation by typing:
   ./sim_sc

3. View the waveforms generated from the SC simulation:
   make view_wave

4. Run Catapult HLS to generate Verilog RTL for DUT:
   catapult -f go_hls.tcl

5. Launch SCVerify / QuestaSim with generated RTL by typing in Catapult command line:
   flow run /SCVerify/launch_make ./scverify/Verify_rtl_v_msim.mk simgui

6. Run RTL Sim by typing in QuestaSim command line:
   run -all
   wave zoom full

7. View the RTL simulation waveforms and compare to SC waveforms before HLS synthesis

8. Delete all generated files
    make clean
