Very simple Matchlib model showing Pre-HLS and Post-HLS simulations that demonstrates Matchlib Pop/Push operations.

This is a very simple and basic round robin arbiter model that synthesizes thru Catapult HLS.
The arbiter itself is coded in a low-level style that is "RTL in SystemC"
in order to get best performance and smallest area.


Steps:

1. Build the SystemC simulation executable by typing:
   make build

2. Run the SC simulation by typing:
   ./sim_sc

3. View the waveforms generated from the SC simulation:
   make view_wave

4. Run Catapult HLS to generate Verilog RTL for DUT:
   catapult -f go_hls.tcl

5. Launch SCVerify / QuestaSim with generated RTL by typing in Catapult command line:
   dofile scverify.tcl

6. Run RTL Sim by typing in QuestaSim command line:
   run -all
   wave zoom full

7. View the RTL simulation waveforms and compare to SC waveforms before HLS synthesis

8. Delete all generated files
    make clean
