Very simple example of clock domain crossing fifo (cdc_fifo) usage in Catapult HLS.
This example uses a simple SystemC tlm_fifo based model in the pre-HLS SystemC simulation and
a very simple simulation-only model in the Verilog RTL.
It is expected that a proper silicon target technology specific clock domain
crossing fifo would be substituted for cdc_fifo.v in real world usage.
(Usually such models are provided by ASIC vendors.)

The Verilog RTL model for the CDC fifo is incorporated into the Catapult-generated
design using the ac_blackbox() feature. This ac_blackbox feature is capable
of substituting any arbitrary Verilog RTL into the Catapult generated design
with the only requirement being that it has the same Verilog port level interface
as the SystemC module in which it is used. Note that in this example
the width parameter is passed from the SystemC module hierarchy into the Verilog RTL
blackbox module (the default width is 8 in the Verilog model, and it is overridden to 32
when it is instantiated in the SystemC design).

This simple example demonstrates usage of multiple clocks in the SystemC DUT which is to 
be synthesized by Catapult.
Note that block1 in the DUT has a clock period of 3 ns and block2 has a clock period of 1 ns.
These clocks are specified in the testbench.


Steps:

1. Build and run the SystemC simulation executable by typing:

   make run

   View the waveforms generated from the SC simulation:
   make view_wave

4. Run Catapult HLS to generate Verilog RTL for DUT:

   BATCH: make go_hls

   INTERACTIVE: catapult -f go_hls.tcl

5. Launch SCVerify / QuestaSim with generated RTL by typing in Catapult command line:
   (will automatically run the simulation and view the full waveform)

   dofile scverify.tcl

6. View the RTL simulation waveforms and compare to SC waveforms before HLS synthesis

7. Delete all generated files
   make clean
