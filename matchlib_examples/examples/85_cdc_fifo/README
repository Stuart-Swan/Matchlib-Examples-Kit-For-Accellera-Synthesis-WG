Very simple example of clock domain crossing fifo (cdc_fifo) usage in Catapult HLS.
This example uses a simple SystemC tlm_fifo based model in the pre-HLS SystemC simulation and
a very simple simulation-only model in the Verilog RTL simulation.
It is expected that a proper silicon target technology specific clock domain
crossing fifo would be substituted for cdc_fifo.v in real world usage.
(Usually such models are provided by ASIC vendors.)

This simple example demonstrates usage of multiple clocks in the SystemC DUT which is to 
be synthesized by Catapult, as well as usage of the ac_blackbox directive to substitute
external Verilog models within Catapult generated RTL.

Note that block1 in the DUT has a clock period of 3 ns and block2 has a clock period of 1 ns.
These clocks are specified in the testbench.


Steps:

1. Build and run the SystemC simulation executable by typing:

   make run

   View the waveforms generated from the SC simulation:
   make view_wave

4. Run Catapult HLS to generate Verilog RTL for DUT:

   BATCH: make go_hls

   INTERACTIVE: catapult -f go_hls.tcl

5. Launch SCVerify / QuestaSim with generated RTL by typing in Catapult command line:
   (will automatically run the simulation and view the full waveform)

   dofile scverify.tcl

6. View the RTL simulation waveforms and compare to SC waveforms before HLS synthesis

7. Delete all generated files
   make clean
