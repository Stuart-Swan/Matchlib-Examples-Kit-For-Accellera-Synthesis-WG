See ../../doc/matchlib_latency_capacity_annotation.pdf

This is a very simple example showing Matchlib Connections Latency and Capacity backannotation.
The latency and capacity info is backannotated from the top.input.json file.
See the connections/annotate.h file for further information.

You can edit the top.input.json file and experiment with different values.
Note the reported times in the log file and also view the waveforms. (Make sure
to remove the out.wlf file after each ./sim_sc run).
Interesting values to try are:

L: 0, C: 0
L: 1, C: 1
L: 1, C: 2
L: 10, C: 10
L: 10, C: 2




Steps:

1. Build the SystemC simulation executable by typing:
   make build

2. Run the SC simulation by typing:
   make run

   Note in particular the times reported for the STIM and RESP transactions.

3. View the waveforms generated from the SC simulation:
   make view_wave

4. Run Catapult HLS to generate Verilog RTL for DUT:
   make hls

5. Launch SCVerify / QuestaSim with generated RTL by typing in Catapult command line:
   dofile scverify.tcl

6. View the RTL simulation waveforms and compare to SC waveforms before HLS synthesis

7. Delete all generated files
   make clean
