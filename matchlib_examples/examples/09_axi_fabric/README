This simple example demonstrates a "throughput accurate" AXI4 bus fabric model
using NVidia Matchlib and Catapult HLS.

See ../../docs/matchlib_intro_dac2019.pdf for a description of this example.

This example also demonstrates usage of the CONNECTIONS_FAST_SIM option for the pre-HLS SystemC
simulation. To use this option, instead of "make build", use "make fast_sim_sc" below. The resulting
executable will then be named "fast_sim_sc".

This example also demonstrates how to build Matchlib models with AddressSanitizer.
(Google AddressSanitizer for more info). To use AddressSanitizer you must
use a build of the SystemC simulator that uses pthreads. Use the "../../../pthreads_build_systemc.sh"
script to build this simulator, then use "make asan_sim_sc" to build the
example here with AddressSanitizer functionality.

Steps:

1. Build SystemC model:
    make build

2. Run SystemC model:
   make run

   Note log output similar to following:
85 ns Top.testbench start_time: 14 ns end_time: 85 ns
85 ns Top.testbench axi beats (dec): 64
85 ns Top.testbench elapsed time: 71 ns
85 ns Top.testbench beat rate: 1109 ps
85 ns Top.testbench clock period: 1 ns

   The DMA is performing a concurrent 64 beat burst read and write to the ram.
   The beat rate indicates that it is achieving nearly 1 beat per clock. 
   (As the burst length increases, the beat rate converges to 1).


3. View VCD waveforms from SystemC model before HLS:

   make view_wave

   Note in the waveforms the concurrent burst read and writes from the DMA fully utilize the AXI4 bus.
   Note the automated burst segmentation (for easy visualization, this example segments every 8 beats
     rather than the standard axi4 of 256 beats)

4. Run catapult HLS:
   catapult -file go_hls.tcl

5. Launch QuestaSim on generated RTL:
   Verification->
      QuestaSim->
        RTL Verilog   (Double click)

6. In QuestaSim GUI, at command prompt:
     run -all

  Note in Questasim transcript log :
 90 ns sc_main/Top/testbench beat rate: 1078 ps
 90 ns sc_main/Top/testbench clock period: 1 ns

  Note in the waveforms the concurrent burst read and writes from the DMA fully utilize the AXI4 bus.

7. If desired, delete generated files:
   make clean
