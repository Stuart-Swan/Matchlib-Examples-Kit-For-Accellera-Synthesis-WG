This design is the same as ../20* however the DUT top level is changed to pixelpipe_mod

Steps:

1. To run the pre-HLS simulation, change directory to ../20* and read the README.

2. To run Catapult, in this directory, type:
  catapult -f go_hls.tcl

3. Within the Catapult GUI, launch QuestaSim to run the RTL simulation.
