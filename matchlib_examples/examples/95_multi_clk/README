Very simple Matchlib model showing Pre-HLS and Post-HLS simulations for a simple design
and testbench using multiple clocks and dynamic reset.


Steps:

1. Build the SystemC simulation executable by typing:
   make build

2. Run the SC simulation by typing:
   make run

3. View the waveforms generated from the SC simulation:
   make view_wave

4. Run Catapult HLS to generate Verilog RTL for DUT:
   make hls

5. Launch SCVerify / QuestaSim with generated RTL by typing in Catapult command line:
   dofile scverify.tcl

6. View the RTL simulation waveforms and compare to SC waveforms before HLS synthesis

7. Delete all generated files
    make clean
