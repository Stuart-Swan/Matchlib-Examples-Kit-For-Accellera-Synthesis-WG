This simple example demonstrates a "throughput accurate" DMA model using NVidia Matchlib and Catapult HLS.

See ../../docs/matchlib_intro_dac2019.pdf for a description of this example.

This example also generates how to automatically generate a Verilog wrapper so that the SystemC
DUT can be instantiated in a Verilog/SystemVerilog TB. Note the use of the auto_gen_wrapper
class within the testbench.cpp file.

Steps:

0. Set your shell environment variables:

1. Build SystemC model:
   make build

2. Run SystemC model:
   ./sim_sc

   Note log output similar to following:
85 ns Top.testbench start_time: 14 ns end_time: 85 ns
85 ns Top.testbench axi beats (dec): 64
85 ns Top.testbench elapsed time: 71 ns
85 ns Top.testbench beat rate: 1109 ps
85 ns Top.testbench clock period: 1 ns

   The DMA is performing a concurrent 64 beat burst read and write to the ram.
   The beat rate indicates that it is achieving nearly 1 beat per clock. 
   (As the burst length increases, the beat rate converges to 1).


3. View VCD waveforms from SystemC model before HLS:

   make view_wave

   Note in the waveforms the concurrent burst read and writes from the DMA fully utilize the AXI4 bus.
   Note the automated burst segmentation (for easy visualization, this example segments every 8 beats
     rather than the standard axi4 of 256 beats)

4. Run catapult HLS:
   catapult -file go_hls.tcl

5. Launch QuestaSim on generated RTL:
   Verification->
      QuestaSim->
        RTL Verilog   (Double click)

6. In QuestaSim GUI, at command prompt:
     run -all

  Note in Questasim transcript log :
 90 ns sc_main/Top/testbench beat rate: 1078 ps
 90 ns sc_main/Top/testbench clock period: 1 ns

  Note in the waveforms the concurrent burst read and writes from the DMA fully utilize the AXI4 bus.

7. If desired, delete generated files:
   make clean
