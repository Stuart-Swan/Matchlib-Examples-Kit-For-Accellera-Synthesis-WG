This simple example demonstrates an "car_factory" that is modeled in SystemC, and shows
three different architectural approaches for the factory.

See ../../docs/sc_hls_modeling_intro.pdf for a description of this example.

For additional information on the AUTO_GEN_FIELDS macro see:
../../doc/auto_gen_field_methods.pdf


Steps:

1. Build the SystemC simulation executable by typing:
   make build

2. Run the SC simulation by typing:
   ./sim_sc

3. View the waveforms generated from the SC simulation:
   make view_wave

4. Delete all generated files
    make clean
