Very simple Matchlib model showing Pre-HLS and Post-HLS simulations

This example shows how to cleanly "stub off" intentionally unconnected
Matchlib connections ports. The approach shown here emits no warnings 
or errors in either the pre-HLS model, during HLS , or in post-HLS simulations.


Steps:

1. Build the SystemC simulation executable by typing:
   make build

2. Run the SC simulation by typing:
   ./sim_sc

3. View the waveforms generated from the SC simulation:
   make view_wave

4. Run Catapult HLS to generate Verilog RTL for DUT:
   catapult -f go_hls.tcl

5. Launch SCVerify / QuestaSim with generated RTL by typing in Catapult command line:
   dofile scverify.tcl

6. Run RTL Sim by typing in QuestaSim command line:
   run -all
   wave zoom full

7. View the RTL simulation waveforms and compare to SC waveforms before HLS synthesis

8. Delete all generated files
    make clean
