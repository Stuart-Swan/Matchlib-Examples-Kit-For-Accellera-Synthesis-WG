Simple example of Verilog TB instantiating Matchlib SystemC DUT (which is the DMA DUT from ../*dma*)

The testbench written in Verilog applies exactly the same stimulus as the
SystemC testbench in ../08_dma


Steps:

1. type "make build" to compile C++ code.

2. type "make vsim_gui" (to run in QuestaSim) -or-
        "make vcs_sim_gui" (to run in VCS-MX)

3. type "do run.do" in vsim console window (if QuestaSim)

4. run 5000 ns

5. wave zoom full


NOTE: the wrapper files dma_wrap.* and ram_wrap.* are automatically generated by doing the following:

cd ../08_dma
make all
./sim_sc

Note the use of the auto_gen_wrapper class within the testbench file in that example.
