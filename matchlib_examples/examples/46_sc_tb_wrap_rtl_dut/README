This example show how to use the Verilog RTL wrapper generated within Matchlib
to wrap the RTL generated by HLS for instantiation in the SC testbench.

The RTL wrapper generated within Matchlib is independent of any particular HLS tool or version,
and should work in all EDA HDL simulators.


Steps:

1. First make the wrappers and the Catapult RTL for the DUT:
cd ../08*
make build
./sim_sc
catapult -shell -f go_hls.tcl

2. Next, compile the wrappers and the DUT RTL with the SC TB:
cd ../46*
make build

3. In the Questa GUI, type:
run -all
