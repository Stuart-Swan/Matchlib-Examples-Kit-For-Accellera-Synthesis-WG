Very simple Matchlib model showing Pre-HLS and Post-HLS simulations that demonstrates Matchlib Pop/Push operations.

This particular example shows how to have a "dat/vld" input/output interface of the DUT
which works properly even though the DUT is pipelined with an II=2 during HLS.
With the dat/vld interface, the "rdy" signal is not present but is implicitly
always true, so that message passing semantics are maintained. The conversion
block in this example simply wires the "rdy" signal to true for the main dut, which uses
normal Matchlib Push/Pop message passing interfaces.

Note that for Catapult HLS stall_mode=flush should not be used with this protocol,
since in some cases the HW generated by catapult if II>1 may attempt to apply backpressure,
which would be incompatible with the assumption that "rdy" is always true in this approach.
So it is always best to use stall_mode=stall with this approach.


Steps:

1. Build the SystemC simulation executable by typing:
   make build

2. Run the SC simulation by typing:
   ./sim_sc

3. View the waveforms generated from the SC simulation:
   make view_wave

4. Run Catapult HLS to generate Verilog RTL for DUT:
   catapult -f go_hls.tcl

5. Launch SCVerify / QuestaSim with generated RTL by typing in Catapult command line:
   dofile scverify.tcl

6. Run RTL Sim by typing in QuestaSim command line:
   run -all
   wave zoom full

7. View the RTL simulation waveforms and compare to SC waveforms before HLS synthesis

8. Delete all generated files
    make clean
