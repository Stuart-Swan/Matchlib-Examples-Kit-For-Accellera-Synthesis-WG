This example works in the Catapult "SystemC flow".


Steps:


1. Build SystemC model:
   make build

2. Run SystemC model:
   ./sim_sc

3. View VCD waveforms from SystemC model before HLS:

   make view_wave

4. Run catapult HLS:
   catapult -file go_hls.tcl

5. Launch ModelSim on generated RTL:
   Verification->
      ModelSim->
        RTL Verilog   (Double click)

6. In ModelSim GUI, at command prompt:
     run -all

7. If desired, delete generated files:
