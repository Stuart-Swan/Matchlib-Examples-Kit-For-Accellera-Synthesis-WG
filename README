Introduction

This kit contains complete source code to enable you to build and run a representative
set of Matchlib examples without needing any EDA tool installations or any other downloads.
The examples run on the open source Accellera SystemC simulator, which is included in this kit.
There is an overview of Matchlib in ./matchlib_examples/doc/matchlib_accellera_presentation.pdf 

Matchlib is starting to be discussed within the Accellera Synthesis Working Group for possible
standardization. If you are interested in participating in the discussion, see the information here:

Setup

This kit should work on most linux compatible systems.

If you are using csh, type:
  source setenvs.csh
to setup necessary shell environment variables.

If you are using sh or bash, type:
  source setenvs.sh
to setup necessary shell environment variables.

All subsequent build steps must be done in a shell that has these environment variables set.



Building the SystemC Library

Before running any examples, you need to build the SystemC simulator.
This only needs to be done once.
Type:
  sh build_systemc.sh

This may take several minutes to complete, and must complete without errors in order
to run the examples.

(To run AddressSanitizer, you must use a build of the SystemC simulator that uses pthreads.
If you want to do this, use
  sh pthreads_build_systemc.sh
instead of the build_systemc.sh command above.)


Running a Test Example
 
To run a test, 
  cd matchlib_examples/examples/05_push_pop
  make build
  ./sim_sc

Read the README files in the examples directories for further steps.


Documentation

It is recommended that you browse all of the documents in matchlib_examples/doc 
Training material is available in matchlib_examples/doc/matchlib_training.pdf


Waveform Viewing

You can use Questa (vsim), VCS, or similar simulators to view the trace.vcd files
produced from the SystemC simulations in the examples. Alternatively you can download
the open source gtkwave waveform viewer (google gtkwave).


Cleanup

To clean up all generated files in the examples and in the SystemC built library,
type:
  sh clean_all.sh
