SystemC Connections interface design of WHVCRouter with support for one or more virtual channels.
(1) To simulate the design with one virtual channel:
    - Set NUM_VCHANNELS = 1
    - Do not define PACKETIDWIDTH 
(2) To simulate the design with two virtual channels:
    - Set NUM_VCHANNELS = 2
    - Set PACKETIDWIDTH = 1

The design, by default, supports only unicast routing. Define ENABLE_MULTICAST to enable support for multicast routing.
