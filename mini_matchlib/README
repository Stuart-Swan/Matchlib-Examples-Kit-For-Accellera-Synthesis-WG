This is a minimalist version of Matchlib Connections 
for use in standardization discussions and for educational use.

This version is completely self-contained and only has dependencies 
on a standard SystemC installation (via $SYSTEMC_HOME), and 
has no dependencies on any other NVidia or Siemens EDA library files.
