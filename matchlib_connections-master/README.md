MatchLib Connections
========
MatchLib Connections is a SystemC library implementing latency-insensitive channels for use by
High-Level synthesis tools.

Documentation on the Connections latency-insensitive channel implementation can be found in the [Connections Guide](pdfdocs/connections-guide.pdf).

Connections has been used as a component of the [MatchLib](https://github.com/NVlabs/matchlib) hardware component library.
For more documentation about compiling and running Connections components, see the MatchLib documentation.
